      A dense fog creeps across the city as your old radio crackles to life:
      “Find the ledger... before midnight.”

      You grab your coat and revolver, heart racing.
    choices:
      "1": "Head to the abandoned docks. -> scene_2a"
      "2": "Call your informant for help. -> scene_2b"

      You reach the docks. Shadows slink between the crates. A flickering lamplight reveals a trapdoor.
      The voice returns: “The name... speak it.”
    choices:
      "1": "Say the suspect's name. -> scene_3a"
      "2": "Knock on the trapdoor three times. -> scene_3b"

      Your informant arrives in a trench coat, handing you a silver key.
      “It’ll unlock the truth. But don’t trust the voice.”
    choices:
      "1": "Go to the docks with the key. -> scene_3c"
      "2": "Ignore his warning and go alone. -> scene_3a"

      The trapdoor creaks open. Inside, the ledger glows faintly on a podium.
      The voice whispers, “Burn it or read it?”
    choices:
      "1": "Burn it. -> scene_4b"
      "2": "Read the contents. -> scene_4a"

  scene_3b:

      The door opens to reveal... nothing. Suddenly, gas fills the room. You collapse.
    choices:
      "1": "Hold your breath and crawl out. -> scene_4a"
      "2": "Let go and fall into unconsciousness. -> scene_4c"

  scene_3c:
    text: >
      The key unlocks a vault inside the docks. Inside: the ledger and a ticking clock.
      A note reads: “Truth or silence?”
    choices:
      "1": "Take the ledger and expose everything. -> scene_4a"
      "2": "Leave it behind and destroy the vault. -> scene_4b"

  scene_4a:
    text: >
      You publish the ledger. Corruption is revealed. The city erupts in protest. You vanish.

      Ending: "You uncovered the truth but became a ghost."

  scene_4b:
    text: >
      You burned the ledger. Silence preserved peace, but guilt lingers in your soul.

      Ending: "The truth died with the flame."

  scene_4c:
    text: >
      You awaken in a cell, unsure how you got there. Across from you: the voice, now a man.
      “Let’s try this again...”

      Ending: "The mystery resets with you."
