    The full moon hovers over the spires of Aetheris as you awaken to a whisper in your mind:
    “Come to the vault... the Ember Stone awaits.”
    The voice is hauntingly familiar.

    You quietly rise from your bed and grab your spell pouch.
  choices:
    "1": "Follow the voice to the vault. -> scene_2a"
    "2": "Wake your mentor before doing anything. -> scene_2b"

    You slip past the guards and descend the spiral stairwell leading to the forbidden vault.
    A glowing sigil pulses on the sealed door—responding to your presence.
    The voice returns: “Say the name...”
  choices:
    "1": "Speak your true name aloud. -> scene_3a"
    "2": "Stay silent and touch the sigil instead. -> scene_3b"

    You gently shake your mentor awake. She looks alarmed but listens.
    “The Ember Stone?” she whispers. “You mustn’t go alone. But if you must go... take this rune.”

    She hands you a glowing rune and warns, “Choose wisely. The stone tests the soul.”
  choices:
    "1": "Go to the vault with the rune. -> scene_3c"
    "2": "Ignore the warning and go alone anyway. -> scene_3a"

    The vault opens, revealing a hovering ember-red crystal. As you approach, shadows twist around you.
    The voice asks, “Will you wield its power or seal it forever?”
  choices:
    "1": "Touch the stone and accept its power. -> scene_4a"
    "2": "Seal it using a binding spell. -> scene_4b"

scene_3b:

    The sigil burns your palm, rejecting your silence. A trap is triggered—
    vines of shadow wrap around your legs. You scream as you're pulled into darkness.
  choices:
    "1": "Cast a flame spell to burn the vines. -> scene_4a"
    "2": "Surrender and see where it takes you. -> scene_4c"

scene_3c:

    The rune glows as you near the Ember Stone. It pulses once—then stills.
    The voice says, “Two paths: Keeper or Conduit. Choose.”
  choices:
    "1": "Become the Keeper—hide the stone away forever. -> scene_4b"
    "2": "Become the Conduit—let its magic flow through you. -> scene_4a"

scene_4a:
  text: >
    Power surges through your veins. The Ember Stone fuses with your heart.
    You are now the Conduit of Flame. Magic returns to the world, but so does its hunger.

    Ending: "You saved the stone—but at what cost?"

scene_4b:
  text: >
    You bind the stone with ancient magic, sealing it in ice and silence.
    The voice vanishes. Peace returns to Aetheris, but your name fades with time.

    Ending: "You chose sacrifice over glory."

scene_4c:
  text: >
    The shadows take you to a hidden realm between worlds.
    There, a hooded figure awaits. “Another chosen one... Let’s begin again.”

    Ending: "You vanished from your world, but entered a greater story."
